Source repo for Putz/Tetazoo MIT Mystery Hunt team. YMMV.

When you checkout a clean copy, you need to do (at least) the following
before things will work:

1. edit pblib.cfg (required edits are obvious)
2. edit Config.pm:
 * Domain name
 * admin password
3. admin-tools expects three files with bits of info:
 * domain
 * ldapdc
 * pw
